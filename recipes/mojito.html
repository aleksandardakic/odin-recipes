        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. 
            Not surprisingly, this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and sugar. 
            The mixture is topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching libation. 
            It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar together to release the flavors. 
            But it's well worth it for a refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the most popular to this day.
