        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This French delicacy is extremely versatile, as it can be filled with virtually anything -- fruits, pudding, mousse for desserts as well as vegetables and meats for dinner. No need to add more oil each time unless the pan begins to stick. Freeze extra crepes for later use. 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
